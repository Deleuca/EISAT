# EISAT
The aim of this project is to help students visualize transformations, a common task in theoretical computer science. The user defines a construction for SAT, and the program will display a visualization of this construction as a graph. This may help the user understand the equivalence between 3-SAT and whichever graph problem he or she desires.
