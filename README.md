# NP-Reduction-Vis
The aim of this project is to help students understand NP-completeness. The user is free to define a construction for one of the finite NP-complete problems supported. The problem is then translated to SAT. The goal is to make this translation as clear as possible to the user. Once the reduction is complete, we visualize the final result as a graph.
